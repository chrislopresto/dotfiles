#compdef r-fu

# ZSH completion script for r-fu. See https://github.com/thrig/zsh-compdef for
# more information on how to set this up in ZSH. This code, r-fu, and where the
# contents of the arlet directory get installed to probably should all agree.

# More complexity would be required to specify completions for the individual
# arlet files. Easy would be a 'usage' line in the arlet.conf that r-fu could
# emit when anything goes awry.
